It will prevent movement along the locked axis.  This is useful if you wanted to move an item to the same Y coordinate as another item but update any other axis (basically have it move only in the up/down direction).\n\n##### Follow Item Path\n\nThe target item will follow a path of defined items.  This is like move to item however you list more than one item.  It will also not follow the path strictly but more of a curved path AND rotate the object-oriented facing forward along the path.  I do have a POC of this working however the Builder action UI is limited and I see no way to be able to pick an unlimited amount of items.   I must pre-configure the max number of selectable items.  I am also not sure how nicely this will work with multi-player.  I plan on leaving this just as an advanced feature only the CE repo will have and not try to pull it into the main repo.\n\n##### Motion Control\n\nAllows a player to pause, stop, resume an action\n\n##### Improve the Move/Rotate/Scale code (TweenSystem)\n\nCurrently, you can execute just one Rotation, Move, or Scale at a time.  Executing two at the same time will cancel one of them out.  I want to add the ability to enable 1 Rotation + 1 Move + 1 Scale all at the same time.    More than 1 of these actions at the same time will have the same cancelation effect as the first just like today but only against that action type: move, rotate or scale.\n\n##### Add Attach/Detach Item\n\nWill attach 1 item to another giving the attached item the position, rotation, scale of the target/host object.  This is very useful to move items in one group instead of individually.  Attach centered flag.\n\n##### Scene Add/remove\n\nAction will let you remove/add an object.  Not the most elegant way to handle the user experience object/movement but has its uses.  One is removed objects do not contribute to scene limitations and boost scene performance.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### Demo / POC\n\nI started work the same day I saw the DAO Funding proposal as a POC and you can see the work I have completed here\n\n\\\\[https://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/77318ec4-638b-4543-a727-688f51b371ce] (https://share.decentraland.org/b/scene/77318ec4-638b-4543-a727-688f51b371ce)\n\nI estimate I have about 70% of the deliverable complete.   I am optimistic that this proposal will be approved because I believe in the value of adding the toolbox functionality (I have already logged more hours than I probably should have not knowing if this will be funded or not).  Should the funding be approved I will finalize my work and make it available as outlined in the deliverables below.\n\n\n## Personnel\n\n### My Portfolio\n\nI won first place in the recent CyberPunk Contes that included a mini-game.  In the mini-game, I had to disable access to areas, disable platforms, keep track of how many times a user did something.  I exclusively used the Builder and the provided smart items to make my scene.  In doing so I am very familiar with the Builder and smart item current limitations.\n\nhttps://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/cyberpunk-2021-meet-the-winners/\nView it in the scene pool here \\\\[https://builder.decentraland.org/view/pool/2b1522a0-3768-426f-990b-9cd716d9cb20] (https://builder.decentraland.org/view/pool/2b1522a0-3768-426f-990b-9cd716d9cb20)\n\nI have made improvements to existing smart items.\\\\\nhttps://github.com/decentraland/smart-items/pull/27\n\nAnother contest submission for the Voxter Contest involved a smart asset they provided.  You can find my submission here:\nhttps://builder.decentraland.org/view/pool/a1890011-77d7-415c-aeb2-452e3a186391?realm=localhost-stub.  Again I used the Builder and but this time also the SDK to enhance the Voxter smart item given to the contestants improving its experience and features in the Builder.  Enhancements can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/pabloes/voxters/pull/2\n\n\n## Roadmap and milestones\n\n### Time to Complete\n\nI am past the 70% completion mark already.  I estimate at most more 2-weeks until completion from the time the proposal is accepted (sadly this is not my full-time job...yet! :) ).  Should the funding be approved I will finalize the work I have already started and make it available as outlined in the deliverables above.\n\n### Deliverables\n\nThe code will be publicly available at my public GitHub repository here. https://github.com/wacaine/dcl-smart-items-ce.  The reasoning for the name of the repository: \"smart-items\" since that is what they are and \"ce\"  for Community Edition.  I will upload the source code and a premade item.zip that can be dragged into the builder for usage.  Directions on how to do that can be found here https://docs.decentraland.org/builder/import-items/\n\nI will also open a pull request against the main smart-items repository (here https://github.com/decentraland/smart-items).   I will work with the Decentraland Foundation team to try and get it merged into the main repo so it will be even easier to make use of.  There is no guarantee the Decentraland Foundation will merge this code into the main branch.  This step is dependent on the Decentraland Foundation Team time to review, code standards, other projects/goals they have going on, and likely not be completed as quickly as the custom drag/drop item.\n\n**[Vote on this proposal on the Decentraland DAO](https://governance.decentraland.org/en/proposal/?id=ba798f30-d382-11eb-b705-3db38bad850a)**", "choices": "yes|no", "snapshot": 12685474, "end": 1624989180, "start": 1624384380, "metadata": {"network": "1", "strategies": [{"name": "erc20-balance-of", "params": {"symbol": "WMANA", "address": "0xfd09cf7cfffa9932e33668311c4777cb9db3c9be", "decimals": 18}}, {"name": "erc721-with-multiplier", "params": {"symbol": "LAND", "address": "0xf87e31492faf9a91b02ee0deaad50d51d56d5d4d", "multiplier": 2000}}, {"name": "decentraland-estate-size", "params": {"symbol": "ESTATE", "address": "0x959e104e1a4db6317fa58f8295f586e1a978c297", "multiplier": 2000}}, {"name": "multichain", "params": {"name": "multichain", "graphs": {"137": "https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/decentraland/blocks-matic-mainnet"}, "symbol": "MANA", "strategies": [{"name": "erc20-balance-of", "params": {"address": "0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942", "decimals": 18}, "network": "1"}, {"name": "erc20-balance-of", "params": {"address": "0xA1c57f48F0Deb89f569dFbE6E2B7f46D33606fD4", "decimals": 18}, "network": "137"}]}}]}}, "snapshot_signature": "0x81889a3b0257522f4c438341e159331ad3150eb6536d255e85aaffe7c60a7ec51ba612db7c2dfd139e53df75f536541691a8e80c08e19686c522d1e2f4c13dbd1c", "snapshot_network": "1", "discourse_id": 2537, "discourse_topic_id": 1194, "discourse_topic_slug": "dao-qmuqfxp-improving-the-toolbox-smart-item-in-builder", "user": "0xbd5b79d53d75497673e699a571afa85492a2cc74", "type": "grant", "status": "active", "title": "Improving the Toolbox Smart Item In Builder", "description": "Should the following Tier 2: a one-time payment of $1500 - $3000 USD in MANA grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved?\n\n## Abstract\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd more functionality to the toolbox smart item to enable users to make more dynamic scenes\n\nI will list the updates and then provide more detail below\n\n*   Add a set of \"Face Player/Item\" and \"Move to Player/Item\"\n*   Add \"Follow path\"\n*   Improve the  Move/Rotate/Scale code (TweenSystem) to be able to run 1 move,1 rotate,1 scale concurrently.

Executing two at the same time will cancel one of them out.  I want to add the ability to enable 1 Rotation + 1 Move + 1 Scale all at the same time.    More than 1 of these actions at the same time will have the same cancelation effect as the first just like today but only against that action type: move, rotate or scale.\n\n##### Add Attach/Detach Item\n\nWill attach 1 item to another giving the attached item the position, rotation, scale of the target/host object.  This is very useful to move items in one group instead of individually.  Attach centered flag.\n\n##### Scene Add/remove\n\nAction will let you remove/add an object.  Not the most elegant way to handle the user experience object/movement but has its uses.

It will prevent movement along the locked axis.  This is useful if you wanted to move an item to the same Y coordinate as another item but update any other axis (basically have it move only in the up/down direction). \n\n##### Follow Item Path \nThe target item will follow a path of defined items.  This is like move to item however you list more than one item.  It will also not follow the path strictly but more of a curved path AND rotate the object-oriented facing forward along the path.  I do have a POC of this working however the Builder action UI is limited and I see no way to be able to pick an unlimited amount of items.   I must pre-configure the max number of selectable items.

These events help to grow the Decentraland community and to build awareness and excitement for the entire platform. Increasing the LAND available to the Foundation would increase the reach and impact of these events.\n*   Specifically, the Decentraland Foundation is hosting a Pride Parade in June to celebrate and promote the rights of LGBTQ+ people and communities. As with physical Pride Parades, Decentraland's parade should be held on public roads. The Foundation needs access to these parcels to deploy the floats and decorations for the event.\n*   In addition to events, the Decentraland Foundation can use these deployment permissions to keep public roads up-to-date with interesting and engaging content.\n*   An example of another feature that the Foundation could deploy on roads is a tram system linking the major areas of the map.

After receiving feedback and input from the community, the previous proposal has been updated to more accurately reflect the risk that a flood of NFT wearables poses to the platform.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe Wearables Editor will allow community content creators to upload collections of the 3D models and textures needed to mint NFT wearables. Before these wearable collections may be minted, they will have to pass through a publication process - part of which includes content moderation and approval to vet out spam and submissions that violate Decentraland's Content Policy.\n\nHowever, there remains the risk that creators will submit an excessive volume of collections, and/or that collections will be submitted with low-quality content.\n\n**This introduces several very significant risks to the entire Decentraland platform:**\n\n*   A high volume of submissions will slow the approval process for other creators\n*   The Catalyst nodes that serve the content for Decentraland incur additional CPU, storage, and bandwidth costs for every wearable item added to the platform\n*   When exploring the world, users must download and render every custom wearable encountered\n*   Other dApps within the Decentraland platform must process every additional added item, negatively impacting their performance for users\n\nGiven the immutability of NFTs, wearables minted in Decentraland will be present forever. They cannot be removed. So, any detrimental effects they have on the performance of the platform cannot be removed.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, it is proposed that the DAO collect a publication fee for each item within a collection, regardless of the rarity selected when minting those items. *This fee is not applied to every NFT minted from each item, only the item.*\n\nThis fee will be transferred to the DAO and may help fund community grants, reimburse the Curation Committee for their work in vetting submissions, and other initiatives as seen fit by the community.\n\n**These fees can always be lowered or increased, but NFTs can never be removed from the platform.**\n\n**Benefits**\n\n*   Disincentivize creators from submitting spam, thus increasing the rate at which legitimate submissions are approved and published\n*   Promotes the submission of very high quality wearables\n*   Protects the Decentraland platform from a permanent drop in performance due to a flood of NFT wearables\n\n**Specification**\n\nEach time a creator submits a collection in the Wearables Editor for publication, they must pay a fee in MANA (at the rate decided on by the DAO) for each item.

With that being disclosed, lets get to the details!\n\n**PROPOSAL**:\nNAME owners receive 100 VP per name owned. Just as MANA holders receive 1 for 1 VP per MANA, NAME holders (who put their MANA to work and also burn it out of existence) should receive 1 for 1 VP proportional to the cost of minting a name.\n\n**BACKGROUND**:\nCurrent DAO participants are MANA holders and LAND holders. LAND owners being granted 2,000 VP per land and MANA holders a 1 for 1 VP per MANA. As it shows, NAME owners currently hold no VP even though contributions to acquire names are arguably the most contributory to the state of Decentraland between the 3; minting a name requires the cost of 100 MANA (which is burnt out of existence!) as well as gas fees, which we all know can be outrageous at times.\n\nI will spare you all the argument of whether or not the minting cost of names should be lowered or not, but I will point out that compared to acquiring LAND, minting a name is dirt cheap. Not only does owning a NAME differentiate you from the flurry of \"User#1fj49\" Metaversers that populate Decentraland, but it is also a domain name -- which can be attached to a parcel (and a 1/1 NFT)!  I am not proposing this question as a means of adding extra utility to make my name investments sell better, but rather give those who do not have thousands of MANA to acquire LAND and also wish to have a unique identity in the next frontier of the internet, a say in how Decentraland progresses.\n\nGiven the recent major developments from the Decentraland dev team in how the DAO operates, I believe it will serve the community well to allow more members to participate in the direction of Decentraland. Since I joined the community a few months ago, I have learned that Decentraland is filled with so many helpful people -- whether it be a newcomer who has a plethora of questions, an up and coming NFT artist who is debuting their work, I have seen more examples than I can count with my fingers of instances of community members going out of their way to show support!
